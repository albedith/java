	/**
	 * The Babylonian algorithm to compute the square root of a number n is as follows:
	 * 1. Make a guess at the answer (you can pick n/2 as your initial guess).
	 * 2. Compute r = n/guess
	 * 3. Set guess = (guess + r) /2
	 * 4. Go back to step 2 for as many iterations as necessary. The more you repeat step
	 * 2 and 3, the closer guess will become to the square root of n.
	 * 
	 * Write a program that inputs an integer for n, iterates through the Babylonian 
	 * algorithm until the guess is within 1% of the previous guess, and outputs the
	 * answer as a double to two decimal places. Your answer will be accurate
	 * even for large values of n.
