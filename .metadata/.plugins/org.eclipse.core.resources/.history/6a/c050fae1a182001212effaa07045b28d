	/**
	 * In the game of craps, a pass line bet proceeds as follows. Two six-sided dice are
	 * rolled; the first roll of the dice in a craps round is called the "come out roll"
	 * A come out roll of 7 or 11 automatically wins, and a come out roll of 2,3, or 12
	 * automatically loses. If a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 is rolled on the come out roll,
	 * that number becomes the point. The player keeps rolling the dice until either 7
	 * or the point is rolled. If the point is rolled first, then the player wins the bet.
	 * If a 7 is rolled first, then the player loses.
	 * 
	 * Write a program that simulates a game of craps using these rules without human input.
	 * Instead of asking for a wager, the program should calculate whether the player would
	 * win or lose. The program should simulate rolling the two dice and calculate the sum.
	 * Add a loop so that the program plays 10,000 games. Add counters that count how many
	 * times the player wins, and how many times the player loses. At the end of the 10,000
	 * games, compute the probability of winning (i.e wins/(wins+losses)) and output this
	 * value. over the long run, who is going to win the most games, you or the house?
	 * 
	 * Note: To generate a random number, use x = Math.random();. For example multiplying
	 * by 6 and converting to an integer results in an integer that  is between 0 and 5.
